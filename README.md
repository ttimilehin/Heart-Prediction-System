ML model for predicting heart disease

Author: Adesola Tolu

A simple system that can be used to predict the presence or abscense of heart disease.
This project is organised as follows (a) data processing and variable selection; (b) building the model(linear regression model)
(c) training and testing; 

lr.pkl: the model as pickle file

heart.csv: dataset used to build the model

Heart_Model: the jupyter notebook containting the analysis and code to build the model

server.py, parseform.py, test.py: contains the python code for deploying the model to make it interactive
